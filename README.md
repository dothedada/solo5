# Sólo 5 (Just5)

This is a todo list in terminal that helps you to prioritize your tasks and prevent burnout.

## Why another f*cking To-Do list?

As part of my Python learning journey, I wanted to strengthen my understanding of algorithms—especially linear programming—while adding a unique twist to something that has been done to exhaustion.

## Flow

### add

1. prompt in terminal
2. parse regular text to build a token
3.

## to-do of the to-do

        - set taks for today -> 
            - get 5 by priority
            - based on energy, 
                - put asside the able ones to delay 
                - add the next in line with the appropiate dificulty
        - import - export task batches
